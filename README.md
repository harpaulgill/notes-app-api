This is the repository for the APIs of my note taking app.  This was created by following the tutorial on https://serverless-stack.com for both the frontend and the backend with a few extra features that were added by me.  To use this application one must clone the notes-api-client repo and then run the npm start command in the directory that the repo was cloned into.  The main screen will allow you to either sign up or login and from there all your notes will be linked to your account.  All the notes and attachments are stored in AWS DynamoDB and S3 storage service.
